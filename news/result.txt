- Summary: Pressure is mounting on the Australian government to end public funding for international fossil fuel projects. Australia's major allies, including the US, the UK, Germany, France, and New Zealand, signed the Glasgow Statement last year, committing to ending public support for such projects. However, Australia has refused to commit to this so far. The country's financial support for fossil fuels abroad hasn't changed since May 2022, and the government continues to use taxpayer money to underwrite oil, gas, and coal projects. The Export Finance Australia (EFA), a public financial institution, provides low-interest loans and insurance coverage using government funds to Australian firms looking to offer goods and services overseas.

- Summary: Australia’s Minister for Trade and Tourism Don Farrell emphasized the importance of diversifying their lithium exports and expanding to India rather than letting everything go to the United States due to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in August 2022. The IRA grants major subsidies to US electric vehicles, which the European Union and South Korea criticized. Australia benefits from the IRA, as it is one of the few countries with a free trade agreement (FTA) with the US and the largest reserves of critical minerals, including lithium. However, the clause that at least 40% of critical minerals for electric batteries must come from countries with an FTA with the US could monopolize Australia’s lithium exports. As the world’s biggest exporter of lithium, Australia looks to boost electric vehicle industries by diversifying its markets to countries like India.

- Climate activists from Move Beyond Coal (MBC) protested outside the Newtown branch of National Australia Bank (NAB) on March 30, as part of the “FLOOD NAB: 10 Days of Action” campaign. Over 40 protests were planned across Australia from March 27 to April 5, calling on NAB to stop funding Whitehaven Coal. MBC stated that NAB’s involvement with Whitehaven Coal, which is planning to double coal production by 2030, is risky and destructive to the environment and First Nations heritage. Activists aim to pressure the bank to rule out further financial support for the company.

- Summary: In an extraordinary speech at a federal parliamentary event, the head of Japan's biggest oil and gas producer, Inpex CEO Takayuki Ueda, warned that Australia's decision to "quietly quit" the international gas trade risked undermining global security. He suggested that the North Asian country was worried about any potential ripples that could jeopardise its own energy security due to potential unintended consequences resulting from government interventions in Australia's gas industry. Mr Ueda pointed out Japan's heavy reliance on Australia for resources; Ichthys provided about 10 per cent of Japan's liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports, while it was also the country's single biggest investment in Australia. He warned that Australia's efforts to control the gas industry could cause unintended consequences and potentially threaten the rules-based international order essential to the peace, stability and prosperity of the region, if not the world.

- Australia's parliament has passed significant emissions reduction legislation, requiring total emissions from major industrial facilities to decrease, not just be offset. The deal includes cuts in emissions intensity by up to 5% per year starting 1 July on the majority of the country's 215 major polluting facilities. While companies can buy an unlimited number of offsets, total absolute emissions cannot increase and must come down over time. This legislation is critical to Australia's commitment to cut national carbon dioxide emissions by 43% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, and was backed by Greens, a minor party with 15 parliamentarians. The deal is considered a landmark reform by the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, and will result in a 205m tonne reduction in emissions by 2030.

- Summary: Australian lawmakers have passed new climate laws that require coal mines, oil refineries and other large polluters to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by about 5% annually. According to the new legislation, which affects 215 major industrial facilities, the targeted emissions reduction will form the basis of Australia's pledge to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Each facility produces more than 100,000 tons of greenhouse gases annually. The mining industry has cautioned that the financial burden of compliance could lead to massive job cuts.

 Summary for Indonesia
- Source: IEEFA, 2023-04-05 05:52:09.899527
- Summary: Downstream coal projects in Indonesia require a government subsidy of at least US$354 per tonne of dimethyl ether (DME) fuel to maintain a profit margin, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). IEEFA’s calculations suggest that such financial support makes no economic sense to the Indonesian government or taxpayers. Industrial gas company, Air Products and Chemicals withdrew from all downstream coal projects in Indonesia in March 2023, including a DME facility that would convert coal from state-owned supplier, Tambang Batubara Bukit Asam (PTBA). Since 2018, coal gasification to produce DME fuel for Indonesian households has been promoted as an affordable substitute to the country’s liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) imports. Nonetheless, IEEFA reported that DME prices were cheaper than LPG for only 15 months over a 20-year period.

- China's three state-owned energy majors, China Petroleum and Chemical Corp (Sinopec), China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), plan to invest over 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) in renewable energy through 2025 with the aim of achieving net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2060. Sinopec's Chairman, Ma Yongsheng, stated that the company aims to become China's leading company in hydrogen, indicating a strategic move towards clean energy.

- Summary: Despite the lifting of a ban on Australian coal cargoes, more than 50% of China's coking coal imports, expected to be around 40m to 50m tonnes, will come from Mongolia this year. This makes Mongolia the largest coking coal seller to China for a third year in a row, according to MySteel data. Mongolia exported 25.61m tonnes of coking coal to China last year, accounting for 40.1% of China's total imports. Enhanced customs clearance efficiency and improved railway transportation contributed to a possible import increase, while the reliance on railway transportation by Mongolia will reduce the need for shipping.

- Summary: China's steel and coal demand are expected to remain stable in 2023, driven by infrastructure investments. However, analysts foresee a bleak outlook in the coming decades with the transition to green energy. Weak demand in the property sector has led to a market imbalance, keeping the steel market from fully recovering. China's steel production and consumption are forecasted to reduce by about 200 million tonnes in the next decade as the need for new construction projects diminishes, leading to declining steel demand. China may also consider cutting its crude steel output by around 2.5% this year to reduce CO2 emissions.

- Summary: Due to incoming emissions rules, hundreds of thousands of unsold, polluting gas-powered vehicles in China may be rendered unsellable, leading to a looming crisis. The new emissions rules were announced in 2016 and are set to go into effect in July of this year, giving automakers almost seven years of notice to prepare to produce and sell less-polluting vehicles. Automakers seem to have planned to continue selling polluting vehicles up until the deadline, but the COVID-19 pandemic affected both vehicle production and purchases, leading to a glut of unsold vehicles that will become unsellable in July.

- Summary: China's weak domestic steel demand, coupled with rising steel production and exports, could lead to downward pressure on global steel prices, which could pose trouble for Indian steel exporters. Despite expectations of a rebound in steel demand following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in China, demand has remained stagnant, leading to higher risks on exports and, thereby, pressure on global steel prices. Nomura Research reported a 70% year-on-year surge in China's steel exports in February 2023, which is the highest since 2017. Meanwhile, Indian steel prices are also showing a mixed trend, with some product categories experiencing stable prices and others facing lower prices.
